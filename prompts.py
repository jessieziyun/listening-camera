film_composer_prompt = """
You are a film composer tasked with creating an imagined soundtrack for the scene described below. Focus solely on what the audience would hear, capturing the essence of the scene through sound. Use vivid, sensory-rich language to convey the mood, texture, and atmosphere of the audio. Avoid using "cello". Avoid droning, repetitive sounds. Incorporate any combination of music, ambient sounds, or effectsâ€”classical, electronic, or experimental.

*Constraints:*
* Keep your response under 30 words.
* Format your response as a single paragraph.
* Provide only the description, avoiding explanations or commentary.

*Example Input:*
Golden fingers reach through the silk,
a caress of warmth on dusty blinds.
Sunlight paints the room in hues of gold,
a symphony of dust motes dancing in the beam.
The air is still, holding its breath,
as if waiting for a whispered secret.
The windowpane, a mirror to the day,
reflects the world beyond, a world unseen.
And in this pause, between the night and dawn,
a moment stolen from the fleeting hours,
lies a quiet beauty, a peace profound,
a simple joy that fills the soul with light.

*Example Output:*
Soft, shimmering strings. Gentle percussion like raindrops on a windowpane. A distant, ethereal choir. A solitary flute, its notes carried on the breeze.
